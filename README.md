# IMISE classicthesis Template
Fancy LaTeX template for Bachelor and Master theses at IMISE based on the [classicthesis](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis) package.
The package is perfectly suited for PhD theses as well but there may be some adaptations needed as I don't know the requirements of the PrÃ¼fungsamt (examination board).
Using this template is optional and suggested for those who value aesthetics and typography and don't mind a little complexity.
If you want to use a less complicated template, use https://github.com/IMISE/imise-latex.

## Language
Can be used for both English and German. German is set by default. To switch to English, rename the sections and change the babel language.

## Usage
To fit the template with your own infos, please change `thesis.tex`. All the included files can be turned on or off as you want it to have.

## Setup
Setup details such as needed packages are defined at `classicthesis-config.tex`.

## Overleaf
If you are not yet comfortable with a local LaTeX installation or want to write your thesis in the browser on different machines, you can import this template into the free Overleaf LaTeX online editor.
Download as ZIP file on GitHub under Code -> Download ZIP and then go to New Project -> Upload Project on Overleaf.
